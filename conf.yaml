  # The mandatory 'commit' value configures the 'Commit' marker on the
  # appropriate timeline widget, and the alert threshold on the related
  # monitor. The default is set to '0' to ensure that any accidental use of a
  # product does not result in unexpected on-demand usage.
  # 
  # The optional 'warning' value configures the warning threshold on the
  # applicable monitor. 'null' disables the warning.
